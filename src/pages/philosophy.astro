      <h2 class="font-display text-2xl text-earth mb-6">The Sanctuary Mindset</h2>
      <p class="text-body text-earth-light mb-6 leading-generous">
        Your home is more than a place to live—it's a sanctuary where you restore, reconnect,
        and nurture the most important relationships in your life. When we approach our living
        spaces with this mindset, every choice becomes an opportunity for intention.
      </p>
      <p class="text-body text-earth-light mb-6 leading-generous">
        The products we bring into our homes carry energy. Some add to our sense of peace;
        others subtract from it. Conventional cat litters—with their synthetic fragrances,
        chemical dust, and artificial additives—work against the harmony we seek to create.
      </p>
      <p class="text-body text-earth-light mb-8 leading-generous">
        Natural alternatives, by contrast, work <em>with</em> us. They support our intention
        to live cleanly, simply, and in alignment with the rhythms of nature.

      <h2 class="text-heading text-earth mb-4">Three Pillars of Mindful Cat Care</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-8">
      <!-- Pillar 1 -->
      <div class="card-organic text-center">
        <div class="w-20 h-20 rounded-full bg-sage/10 flex items-center justify-center mx-auto mb-6">
          <span class="text-4xl">🌿</span>
        </div>
        <h3 class="font-display text-xl text-earth mb-4">Natural Ingredients</h3>
        <p class="text-body-sm text-earth-light leading-generous">
          We honor what comes from the earth. Corn, wheat, pine, walnut, coconut—these
          materials have nourished life for millennia. In our cat's litter box, they
          continue that legacy of gentle, effective care.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Pillar 2 -->
      <div class="card-organic text-center">
        <div class="w-20 h-20 rounded-full bg-terracotta/10 flex items-center justify-center mx-auto mb-6">
          <span class="text-4xl">🕊️</span>
        </div>
        <h3 class="font-display text-xl text-earth mb-4">Gentle Effectiveness</h3>
        <p class="text-body-sm text-earth-light leading-generous">
          Powerful doesn't mean harsh. Nature has perfected odor control through millions
          of years of evolution. Activated carbon, plant fibers, and natural enzymes
          work quietly but profoundly to maintain freshness.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Pillar 3 -->
      <div class="card-organic text-center">
        <div class="w-20 h-20 rounded-full bg-gold/20 flex items-center justify-center mx-auto mb-6">
          <span class="text-4xl">♻️</span>

        <h3 class="font-display text-xl text-earth mb-4">Sustainable Cycles</h3>
        <p class="text-body-sm text-earth-light leading-generous">
          What we use returns to the earth. Biodegradable materials complete nature's
          cycle, leaving no lasting footprint. This is caring that extends beyond
          our homes to the world we share.

      <h2 class="font-display text-2xl text-earth mb-6">Your Cat as Wellness Guide</h2>
      <p class="text-body text-earth-light mb-6 leading-generous">
        Cats are masters of presence. They don't worry about yesterday or tomorrow—they
        live fully in the now. When we observe them, we're reminded of what true relaxation
        looks like, what authentic comfort feels like.
      </p>
      <p class="text-body text-earth-light mb-6 leading-generous">
        This presence makes cats remarkably sensitive to their environment. They notice
        when something feels "off." They respond to the energy of products, spaces, and
        the people around them. A cat who avoids their litter box may be telling us
        something important about what we've placed in their most intimate space.
      </p>
      <p class="text-body text-earth-light mb-8 leading-generous">
        By choosing natural litter, we listen to this wisdom. We create an environment
        where our cats can be fully themselves—where their instincts are honored rather
        than overridden.
