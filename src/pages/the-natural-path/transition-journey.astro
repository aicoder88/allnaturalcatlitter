  <p>
    Change, even positive change, benefits from gentleness. Your cat has grown
    accustomed to their current litter—its texture, its scent, its familiar feel
    beneath their paws. Introducing something new requires patience and respect
    for their process.
  </p>

  <h2>The Gradual Path</h2>

  <p>
    The most successful transitions happen slowly. Begin by adding just 25% natural
    litter to your cat's existing litter. Mix thoroughly so the textures blend.
    Observe how your cat responds over 3-5 days.
  </p>

  <p>
    If all seems well—if your cat continues using the box normally, without hesitation
    or stress—increase to 50% natural litter. Hold at this ratio for another week.
    Then move to 75%. Finally, complete the transition.
  </p>

  <p>
    This gradual approach respects your cat's need for consistency while gently
    introducing new textures and scents. Most cats adapt beautifully when given time.
  </p>

  <h2>Reading Your Cat's Response</h2>

  <p>
    Throughout the transition, become a careful observer. Signs that all is well include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Normal digging and covering behavior</li>
    <li>Relaxed posture when using the box</li>
    <li>Regular visit frequency</li>
    <li>No accidents outside the box</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Signs that you may need to slow down include hesitation before entering the box,
    rushing through the process, or avoiding the box entirely. These aren't failures—
    they're communications. Your cat is telling you they need more time.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    "There is no timeline for transition except your cat's own. Trust their wisdom,
    and they'll guide the pace."
  </blockquote>

  <h2>When to Pause</h2>

  <p>
    If your cat shows resistance, don't push forward. Return to a ratio that felt
    comfortable—perhaps back to 25% natural litter—and hold there longer. Some cats
    need several weeks at each stage.
  </p>

  <p>
    Consider, too, whether the specific natural litter you've chosen is the right fit.
    Just as we have texture preferences, cats do too. A cat who resists corn-based
    litter might embrace wheat. One who dislikes pine pellets might love fine pine
    shavings.
  </p>

  <p>
    The journey isn't about reaching a destination quickly. It's about finding what
    works for your unique cat in your unique home.
  </p>

  <h2>The Two-Box Method</h2>

  <p>
    If gradual mixing isn't working, try offering choice instead. Set up a second
    litter box with the new natural litter while keeping the original box unchanged.
    Let your cat explore both on their own terms.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many cats will naturally begin using the natural option once they've had time
    to investigate without pressure. When they consistently choose the natural
    litter, you can retire the old box.
  </p>

  <h2>Celebrating Small Steps</h2>

  <p>
    Every use of the new litter is a success. Every comfortable moment in the box
    is progress. This isn't a race—it's a gentle shift toward a healthier way of
    living together.
  </p>

  <p>
    When the transition is complete, you may find your cat actually prefers the
    new arrangement. Many guardians report that their cats seem more relaxed,
    more willing to use the box, more thorough in their covering behavior.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your patience has given them something valuable: a space that feels more natural,
    more aligned with their instincts, more like the sanctuary it should be.
